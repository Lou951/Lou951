<div align=center><strong> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </strong>

Welcome to my Github. Thanks for visiting.


I am a M.E.R.N Stack Developer based in Newport, UK. 

After completing a bootcamp with LeWagon in 2022. I have continued to develop my skills as a fullstack developer. The bootcamp primarily focused on Full Stack Web Development with the Ruby on Rails stack, with front end languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. During the bootcamp I developed two projects alongside my team including an Air BnB style clone called Islands 'R' Us and an app aimed at groups of people who share spaces and would split bills called Homie. 

Since then I have wanted to develop my passion for the JavaScript language and have focused on being able to create full stack applications using the MERN Stack. I have completed multiple projects including a personal portfolio, a CRUD application, an ecommerce store and a twitter clone.
